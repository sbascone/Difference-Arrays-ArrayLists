Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

Description
This project is about the difference between Array and ArrayList in Java.

Arrays:
Have a fixed size (you can’t change the size after creating it)
Use [] to add or get values
Work fast, but not easy to change

ArrayLists:
The size can grow or shrink
Use methods like .add() and .get()
Easier to use when you don’t know the number of items

Example Code

The file Main.java shows how both Array and ArrayList work.
It prints the values, and I added comments to help explain the differences.
