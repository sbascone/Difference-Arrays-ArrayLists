# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

## Description

This project shows the difference between Arrays and ArrayLists in Java.

### Arrays:
- Fixed size (you must choose the size at the beginning)
- Use `[]` to access values
- Faster, but harder to change

### ArrayLists:
- Size can grow and shrink
- Use methods like `.add()` and `.get()`
- Easier to use for adding and removing items

## Example Code

The `Main.java` file includes both an Array and an ArrayList. Each prints values to the console. Comments explain how they are different.
